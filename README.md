# DECODER
A project to decode the genome of reticular structures using shape grammar.

This page documents the process and code related to the project. 

# STEPS 
 - The project is divided 2 parts:
     1. generative phase using shape grammar
     2. Using ML to filter the appropriate parameters, rules and weights.

# ROADMAP
 - A broad structure of the project can be found [in this document](/Decoder-plugin_notes.md).
