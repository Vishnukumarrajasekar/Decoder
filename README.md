# RL-Guider
A project to guide a generative system based on shape grammar and graphic statics to produce feasible reticular structures.

This page documents the process and code related to the project. 

# STEPS 
 - The project is divided 2 parts:
     1. Generative phase: Using shape grammar and graphic statics. 
     2. Guiding phase: Using an RL model to guide the generative system towards feasible solutions

# ROADMAP
 - A broad structure along with key points of the project can be found [in this document](/RL-Guider_notes.md).

# RESEARCH
